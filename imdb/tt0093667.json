{"rating": 5.8, "genres": ["comedy"], "description": "This is an intelligent and sarcastic movie about daily racism. Our heroes are the painter Denise Santrose and Rachid, a black and an Algerian, who seek an apartment in Paris, France. Both meet Virginie, who'd be willing to help them to the vacant apartment of her stepfather, but he'd rather rent to some low-lifes than to to a black or an Algerian.
