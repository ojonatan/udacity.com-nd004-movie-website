It's a puppet flick full of drugs, sex, guns and porn. As an early Peter &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; Jackson flick it also features a bit of gore. The puppets don't just die, they get mushed.I really liked it however I imagine some people would be repelled by it. Jackson himself said in his Oscars speech that it was 'wisely overlooked' by the Academy. He's the first to admit that this type of movie simply aint going to be to everyones taste!However if your open minded and looking for something a little 'out there' then I would check it out.8/10", "rating": "8/10"}, "released": "1989-12-08"}
