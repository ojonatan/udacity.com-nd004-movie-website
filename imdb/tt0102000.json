When I first saw this movie I was quite impressed because of its combination of realism on the one hand and satirical elements on the other. The film is first of all an allusion to private investigative characters like Philip Marlowe. It ironices not only its predecessors in that genre but also the way the turkish people in Germany have been shown in german cinema before -- Kemal Kayankaya, the main character, is a turk who can not speak turkish, because his parents died when he was a little infant. Afterwards he grew up with german parents. So all the prejudices against the turks he has to face seem ridiculous to the audience. Doris Doerrie, the director and writer of &quot;Happy Birthday, Tuerke!&quot; lets you gain a rather realistic glance at the situation of the turkish &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; without treating them as a poor and abused minority and victims.", "rating": "9/10"}, "cast": ["Hansa Czypionka", "\u00d6zay Fecht", "Meret Becker", "Doris Kunstmann", "Lambert Hamel", "Joachim Kr\u00f3l", "Nina Petri", "Christian Schneller", "\u00d6mer Simsek", "Ulrich Wesselmann", "Richard Beek", "Emin Boztepe", "Siir Eloglu", "Ben Engel", "Dagmar Franz"], "directors": [], "writers": [], "youtube_id": "9WzV1XacAgY", "duration": "1h 49min", "type": "title", "id": "tt0102000", "released": "1992-01-09"}
