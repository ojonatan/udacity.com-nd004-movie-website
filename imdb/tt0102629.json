Apart from that,the acting is absolutely superb.Loriot and Evelyne Hamann really make the best(and the funniest) out of their characters! The best thing is,that the situations are very near to the real life and totally weird at the same time. This film is full of strange but wonderful humour and I recommend to everyone who wants to see some intelligent comedy. This movie is nothing for fans of no-brainer-flicks!", "rating": "10/10"}, "cast": ["Evelyn Hamann", "Vicco von B\u00fclow", "Irm Hermann", "Hans-Peter Korff", "Dagmar Biener", "Ortrud Beginnen", "H.H.
