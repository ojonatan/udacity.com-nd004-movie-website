The local Radio DJ has an affair with a restauranters wife; we are agonizingly close as the fallout of betrayal and discovery manifests itself.Its not all doom and gloom though; we get comedic moments with an ever-growing street side performance troupe that becomes the thorn in the side; and the adultery itself is handled initially with a playful jocularity that belies what is to come.Let down by not really having a style and sticking to it to maintain consistency; 'Grill Point' is an interesting but flawed drama.", "rating": "8/10"}}
