We tried catching fire and flowers and once got hit in the face by a bird. The 3d seems to be on a new level of excellence. I&#x27;m a teacher and I totally now understand what scientists mean from cavemen to hunterers/gatherers and I think it will help children see it too and introduce them to tar pits, saber tooth tigers, earthquakes, and a lot of science stuff. The story was great, the characters were realistic to a family, and although sometimes the dad didn&#x27;t get any respect, in the end it was apparent his love for his family and theirs for him. I highly recommend this to adults and children.", "rating": "10/10"}, "released": "2013-03-29"}
