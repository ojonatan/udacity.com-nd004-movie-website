The movie has a nice flow and is filled with quirky characters and wry observations about people and differences. Most of the actors are well-known danish character actors, who seems to have a lot of fun. Some of the humor do require a little knowledge of Denmark and Sweden, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult for anyone to relate to most of the situations. Danish superstar Tina Dico supplies the soundtrack and some really catchy songs.", "rating": "8/10"}}
