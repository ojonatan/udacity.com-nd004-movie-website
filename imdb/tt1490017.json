With the age difference between us we both loved the movie for different reasons. For me it was superb. It&#x27;s amazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and interact with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and even some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to anyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever. You&#x27;d be surprised to see how relevant this movie will feel. I think all people from all ages can find something in this movie that will warm their heart. A timeless classic for sure.", "rating": "9/10"}, "cast": ["Will Arnett", "Elizabeth Banks", "Craig Berry", "Alison Brie", "David Burrows", "Anthony Daniels", "Charlie Day", "Amanda Farinos", "Keith Ferguson", "Will Ferrell", "Will Forte", "Dave Franco", "Morgan Freeman", "Todd Hansen", "Jonah Hill"], "directors": [], "writers": [], "youtube_id": "fZ_JOBCLF-I", "duration": "1h 40min", "type": "title", "id": "tt1490017", "released": "2014-02-07"}
