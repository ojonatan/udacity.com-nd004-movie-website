And when i had opportunity to watch it, i was more than happy. Great story line, reminds me Garfield and his new &#x22;friend&#x22; dog. Many characters such as lazy cat and hamster who can&#x27;t find his way home made movie incredible funny. I love Kevin Hart voice and his expressions being that little, loud and angry bunny makes it more interesting. The writing was excellent, made my mom, youngest sister, and myself constantly laugh. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. I hope that there will be a second part of this life of pets.", "rating": "10/10"}}
